In the first phase i have build a machine learning model that automates account receivables given a dataset/data(supervised machine learning). We have to understand the data, preporcess the data, execute feature engineering and finally train a model to predict account receivables. Project directory has python file named as "PAYMENT PREDICTION" and the related datasets.
